# RQGIS 0.1.0.9000

* Fine-tuning of the documentation files
* Removing a bug from `run_qgis`. Function argument `load_output` now first checks if the output was really created.
* Deleting redundancies in functions `build_cmds`, `check_apps` and `execute_cmds`
* Removing empty string from `find_algorithms` output
* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.
