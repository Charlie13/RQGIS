# Vignette Info

This vignette shows how to set up your local QGIS, SAGA and GRASS environments on your local PC to get RQGIS running smoothly. We present example combinations of different software versions for each operating system (Windows, Mac, Linux) that will interact nicely with each other and RQGIS. Other combinations of software version combination of QGIS, SAGA and GRASS than the ones presented here might also work without problems. However, for time reasons we can not test all possible combinations and if you encounter problems it is recommended to use the latest stable version of all software packages.  

Overall, RQGIS allows access to more than 1000 geoalgorithms. However, please note that the number of geoalgorithms you can use from within RQGIS depends on the platform, the system architecture, the selection of installed third-party provides and software package versions.

# Windows

There are at least two options to install QGIS on Windows in such a way that it can be accessed from RQGIS. The first option is the Standalone Installer from the [QGIS installer page](https://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html). This will install QGIS along with the third-party providers GRASS and SAGA. However, if you would like to use even more third-party providers (e.g., GDAL, GEOS, Taudem, OTB, POSTGis, etc.), we recommend to use the OSGeo4W Network installer. This installer is available on the [QGIS installer page](https://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html) as well as on the [OSGeo4W-website](http://trac.osgeo.org/osgeo4w/). 

To install OSGeo4W, the easiest way is to to use the Express installation:

</center>

We are sorry, that our installer uses a German dialog. It appears that OSGeo4w automatically uses the language in accordance with the IP-address. Nevertheless, it should be simple enough to follow our steps.

1. Select "Express Installation" 
2. Next check "QGIS, GRASS and GDAL"
3. Start the installation.

Using the advanced settings is slightly more complicated but will give you the advantage of being able to select the third-party providers you would like to use.

1. Run the OSGeo4W setup and choose the advanced installation. 

<center>
  <img src="D:\programming\R\RQGIS\RQGIS\figures\01_initial_setup.PNG" width="50%" height="50%">
</center>

2. Subsequently, accept the default settings until you reach the “Select Packages” window.

<center>
  <img src="D:\programming\R\RQGIS\RQGIS\figures\04_select_packages.PNG" width="50%" height="50%">
</center>

3. After expanding the command line utilities, we choose several commandline tools such as gdal and python-core (of course, you can select other components as well):

<center>
  <img src="D:\programming\R\RQGIS\RQGIS\figures\05_command_line_utilties.PNG" width="50%" height="50%">
</center>

Additionally, we choose the Desktop-GIS GRASS 6 & 7, the Orfeo Toolbox, the latest QGIS release and SAGA. We also installed gvSIG, though so far it is not accessible from QGIS.

<center>
  <img src="D:\programming\R\RQGIS\RQGIS\figures\06_Desktop_install.PNG" width="50%" height="50%">
</center>

4. The rest we leave as is, click "Next" and wait for the OSGeo4W-suggestions which we accept.

<center>
  <img src="D:\programming\R\RQGIS\RQGIS\figures\08_suggestions.PNG" width="50%" height="50%">
</center>

Clicking "Next" once more will start the download and installation process which might take a while.

If you wish to to modify, uninstall or update some of the installed components, you might do so later on by running "..\OSGeo4W\bin\osgeo4w-setup.exe". Or you download and run the latest [OSGeo4W-executable](http://trac.osgeo.org/osgeo4w/)

If you additionally want to use the **LiDAR processing tools** (LAStools), please follow the steps found [here](https://rapidlasso.com/2013/09/29/how-to-install-lastools-toolbox-in-qgis/).

# Mac OS X

## Binary installation
For Mac, please follow this link [https://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html](https://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html) to install QGIS. Both LTR and current release will work. Please make sure to also install GDAL seperately, preferably following this link [http://www.kyngchaos.com/software/frameworks](http://www.kyngchaos.com/software/frameworks) or using your own package manager (Homebrew, Fink, MacPorts). Note that problems might occur mixing up the binary QGIS installation and framework installations from package managers. 

## Using package management systems
Since several problems occur when trying to install QGIS with package managers (e.g. [this Stackexchange question](http://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/182472/installing-qgis-using-homebrew)), it is recommended to use the binary QGIS installation. Otherwise it can not be guaranteed that all dependencies will work:

- Homebrew: If you have already QGIS running and correctly configured via Homebrew, RQGIS should work and `set_env()` should find your root path. 
- Fink: <untested>
- MacPorts: <untested>

## GRASS

## SAGA
First, download Fink from Fink Project and [install it](http://www.finkproject.org/doc/bundled/install-first.php).
Then download the following .info file for SAGA:   [http://fink.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/fink/experimental/babayoshihiko/finkinfo/saga.info](http://fink.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/fink/experimental/babayoshihiko/finkinfo/saga.info)  
Copy this file in /sw/fink/dists/local/main/finkinfo. You will need root access. Finally, run
fink install saga
This will automatically download and install necessary libraries as well.

## Troubleshooting
Warnings appears when running any RQGIS command. Does not affect usage.

# Linux

## QGIS
For Debian/Ubuntu, please follow the installation instructions found under this [link](https://www.qgis.org/de/site/forusers/alldownloads.html). Note that if you install QGIS from the built-in Software managers/repositories, you will most likely get a rather old QGIS version as these repositories only getting updated quite sparsely (especially if your running older Ubuntu builds like 14.04). We did not test other Linux derivates at the moment.

You can also just use this simplified guide:

1. Open a terminal window
2. Type `sudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list`
3. Move to the end of the document and add the following lines:   
  `#QGIS`  
  `deb https://www.qgis.org/debian xenial main` "xenial" here refers to 
  Ubuntu build name which is "Xenial Xerus" for Version 16.04. For Ubuntu 14.04
  replace "xenial" with "trusty". Save it and exit. 
4. In the terminal window: 
add `wget -O - http://qgis.org/downloads/qgis-2015.gpg.key | gpg --import` 
followed by `gpg --export --armor 3FF5FFCAD71472C4 | sudo apt-key add -`
5. Terminal: `sudo apt-get update` 
6. Terminal: `sudo apt-get install qgis python-qgis qgis-plugin-grass`

You basically added the most recent stable QGIS repository to your list of
repositories. Everytime you are running `sudo apt-get update` now, Ubuntu checks for
new QGIS updates. 

## GRASS

## SAGA
To use SAGA functions within (R)QGIS, you naturally need to install SAGA GIS. To install the most recent SAGA version, simply execute the following lines in a terminal window: 

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:johanvdw/saga-gis  
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install saga
```

## Orfeo Toolbox
Orfeo Toolbox has to be installed on your own on Linux systems. To do so, visit [this site](https://www.orfeo-toolbox.org/download/) and save the .run script on your Desktop. 
OTB needs to be installed in the first place in a folder where you have access to. Later on we will the important folders to their desired location. 

We recommend to create a folder called "Applications" under `/home/<YourUserName>/`. To do so, simply execute `mkdir /home/<YourUserName/Applications/`. Then move your .run script to this location by `mv /home/<YourUserName>/Desktop/<filename> /home/<YourUserName>/Applications`. Now run the script from the terminal using `sh /usr/<NameOfScript>`. To ensure that (R)QGIS can find the algorithms we have to move the contents of your installation to the specfic directories. Afterwards you can delete the first installation under [...]/Applications.

(R)QGIS assumes the "OTB applications folder" to be located at "/usr/lib/otb/applications". Call `sudo mv /home/<YourUserName>/Applications/<YourOTBInstallation>/lib/otb /usr/lib/`. This command will move our applications folder (located under [...]/otb) to the desired location. We need "sudo" rights to move a folder there. 

Last, we need to move the "OTB command line tools" contents to their desired place. Call `cp -a /home/<YourUserName>/Applications/<YourOTBInstallation>/bin/. /usr/bin`. 

Now QGIS should list the OTB tools under "Processing Toolbox" and RQGIS should list them when calling `find_algorithms()`. 

For further reading please see the official [QGIS manual](/home/<YourUserName>/Applications/<YourOTBInstallation>/) for OTB installation under Linux. 

## RQGIS
**Compiling RQGIS on a fresh Linux installation:**

After installing R, you can install RQGIS using the `devtools` package. This package depends on several libraries which you should install a priori. We recommend to use the "Synaptic" package manager for this. To install synaptic, please 
use the built-in "Ubuntu Software" app or any other built-in program of your Linux installation. Search for "libssl-dev","libcurl4-openssl-dev" "libssh2-1-dev" and install all dependencies. Afterwards install the R-package "roxygen2" and then "devtools". If that succeeded, you can install RQGIS using `devtools::install_github("jannes-m/RQGIS")` and load it with `library("RQGIS")`.
