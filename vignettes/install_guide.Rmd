# Vignette info

This vignette guides you through the installation process of QGIS, GRASS- and SAGA-GIS on three different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux). Following our instructions should ensure that RQGIS will work properly. We recommend to use the latest stable version of all software packages. Though other versions might also work with RQGIS, we did not test this.

Overall, RQGIS allows access to more than 1000 geoalgorithms. However, please note that the number of geoalgorithms you can use from within RQGIS depends on the platform, the system architecture, the selection of installed third-party providers and software package versions.

# Windows

There are at least two options to install QGIS on Windows in such a way that it can be accessed from RQGIS. The first option is the Standalone Installer from the [QGIS installer page](https://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html). This will install QGIS along with the third-party providers GRASS and SAGA. However, if you would like to use even more third-party providers (e.g., GDAL, GEOS, Taudem, OTB, POSTGis, etc.), we recommend to use the OSGeo4W Network installer. This installer is available on the [QGIS installer page](https://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html) as well as on the [OSGeo4W-website](http://trac.osgeo.org/osgeo4w/). 

To install OSGeo4W, the easiest way is to to use the Express installation:

  <img src="D:\programming\R\RQGIS\RQGIS\figures\00_express.PNG" width="50%" height="50%">
</center>

We are sorry, that our installer uses a German dialog. It appears that OSGeo4w automatically uses the language in accordance with the IP-address. Nevertheless, it should be simple enough to follow our steps.

1. Select "Express Installation" 
2. Next check "QGIS, GRASS and GDAL"
3. Start the installation.

Using the advanced settings is slightly more complicated but will give you the advantage of being able to select the third-party providers you would like to use.

1. Run the OSGeo4W setup and choose the advanced installation. 

<center>
  <img src="D:\programming\R\RQGIS\RQGIS\figures\01_initial_setup.PNG" width="50%" height="50%">
</center>

2. Subsequently, accept the default settings until you reach the “Select Packages” window.

  <img src="D:\programming\R\RQGIS\RQGIS\figures\04_select_packages.PNG" width="50%" height="50%">
</center>

3. After expanding the command line utilities, we choose several commandline tools such as gdal and python-core (of course, you can select other components as well):

<center>
  <img src="D:\programming\R\RQGIS\RQGIS\figures\05_command_line_utilties.PNG" width="50%" height="50%">
</center>

Additionally, we choose the Desktop-GIS GRASS 6 & 7, the Orfeo Toolbox, the latest QGIS release and SAGA. We also installed gvSIG, though so far it is not accessible from within QGIS.

<center>
  <img src="D:\programming\R\RQGIS\RQGIS\figures\06_Desktop_install.PNG" width="50%" height="50%">
</center>

4. The rest we leave as is, click "Next" and wait for the OSGeo4W-suggestions which we accept.

<center>
  <img src="D:\programming\R\RQGIS\RQGIS\figures\08_suggestions.PNG" width="50%" height="50%">
</center>

Clicking "Next" once more will start the download and installation process which might take a while.

If you wish to to modify, uninstall or update some of the installed components, you might do so later on by running `../OSGeo4W/bin/osgeo4w-setup.exe`. Alternatively, you can download and run again the latest [OSGeo4W-executable](http://trac.osgeo.org/osgeo4w/).

If you additionally want to use the **LiDAR processing tools** (LAStools), please follow the steps found [here](https://rapidlasso.com/2013/09/29/how-to-install-lastools-toolbox-in-qgis/).

# Mac OS X

## Binary installation
For Mac, please follow this link [https://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html](https://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html) to install QGIS. Both LTR and current release will work. Please make sure to also install GDAL seperately, preferably following this link [http://www.kyngchaos.com/software/frameworks](http://www.kyngchaos.com/software/frameworks) or using your own package manager (Homebrew, Fink, MacPorts). Note that problems might occur mixing up the binary QGIS installation and framework installations from package managers. 

## Using package management systems
Since several problems occur when trying to install QGIS with package managers (e.g. [this Stackexchange question](http://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/182472/installing-qgis-using-homebrew)), it is recommended to use the binary QGIS installation. Otherwise it can not be guaranteed that all dependencies will work:

- Homebrew: If you have already QGIS running and correctly configured via Homebrew, RQGIS should work and `set_env()` should find your root path. 
- Fink: <untested>
- MacPorts: <untested>

## GRASS

## SAGA
First, download Fink from Fink Project and [install it](http://www.finkproject.org/doc/bundled/install-first.php).
Then download the following .info file for SAGA:   [http://fink.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/fink/experimental/babayoshihiko/finkinfo/saga.info](http://fink.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/fink/experimental/babayoshihiko/finkinfo/saga.info)  
Copy this file in /sw/fink/dists/local/main/finkinfo. You will need root access. Finally, run
fink install saga
This will automatically download and install necessary libraries as well.

Source: [https://sourceforge.net/p/saga-gis/wiki/Compiling%20SAGA%20on%20Mac%20OS%20X/](https://sourceforge.net/p/saga-gis/wiki/Compiling%20SAGA%20on%20Mac%20OS%20X/)

## Troubleshooting
Warnings appears when running any RQGIS command. Does not affect usage.

```

# Linux

## QGIS (and GRASS)
If you install QGIS from the built-in Software managers/repositories, you will most likely get an outdated QGIS version since these repositories are seldomly updated (especially if your using Ubuntu older than 14.04). To install the latest QGIS release, we recommend to follow the installation instructions from the [QGIS installers website](https://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/alldownloads.html). 

Here, we just describe exemplarily the QGIS installation for Debian/Ubuntu following the description found [here] (https://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/alldownloads.html#debian-ubuntu). RQGIS should work as well with Linux derivatives other than Ubuntu. However, we did not test this.

Open a terminal window. Make sure to remove all the QGIS and GRASS packages you may have installed before from other repositories. Then execute:


```sh
# add QGIS repository for Ubuntu 16.04 to sources.list
sudo sh -c 'echo "deb https://www.qgis.org/debian xenial main" >> /etc/apt/sources.list'
# QGIS repository for Ubuntu 14.04
# sudo sh -c 'echo "deb https://www.qgis.org/debian trusty main" >> /etc/apt/sources.list'
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install qgis python-qgis qgis-plugin-grass
```

If this results in keyserver errors, add the qgis.org repository public key to your apt keyring.

```sh
wget -O - http://qgis.org/downloads/qgis-2015.gpg.key | gpg --import
# to verify, run:
# gpg --fingerprint 3FF5FFCAD71472C4
gpg --export --armor 3FF5FFCAD71472C4 | sudo apt-key add -
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install qgis python-qgis qgis-plugin-grass
```

This will install the latest and most stable QGIS release as well as GRASS-GIS as third-party provider. Additionally, everytime you now run `sudo apt-get update`, Ubuntu will check for QGIS updates. 

## SAGA
To use SAGA functions within (R)QGIS, you naturally need to install SAGA GIS. To install the most recent SAGA version, simply execute the following lines in a terminal window: 

```sh
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:johanvdw/saga-gis  
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install saga
```

## Orfeo Toolbox (OTB)
You can download the Orfeo Toolbox from [here](https://www.orfeo-toolbox.org/download/). We save the .run-script to the Desktop. Of course, you might select any other accesible folder. Next, we create a folder named "Applications" to which we move the .run script. Finally, we install OTB. Please note that so far there is only a **64-bit** OTB version available. This version does not work on 32-bit machines!

```sh
mkdir /home/<YourUserName>/Applications/
mv /home/<YourUserName>/Desktop/<filename> /home/<YourUserName>/Applications
sh /home/<YourUserName>/Applications/<NameOfScript>
```
(R)QGIS assumes that the "OTB applications folder" is located at "/usr/lib/otb/applications" (see also [QGIS manual](https://docs.qgis.org/2.14/en/docs/user_manual/processing/3rdParty.html#orfeo-toolbox)). Therefore, we need to move the OTB installation to the corresponding folder: 

```sh
# move applications folder
sudo mv /home/<YourUserName>/Applications/<YourOTBInstallation>/lib/otb /usr/lib/
# commandline tools
cp -a /home/<YourUserName>/Applications/<YourOTBInstallation>/bin/. /usr/bin
```
OTB algorithms should be now availabe in the "Processing Toolbox" and in RQGIS (use `find_algorithms()` to check). Finally, we clean up after ourselves by deleting the previously created Applications folder:

```sh
rmdir /home/<YourUserName>/Applications/
```
