# Vignette info

This vignette guides you through the installation process of QGIS, GRASS- and SAGA-GIS on three different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux). Following our instructions should ensure that RQGIS will work properly. With the exception of SAGA, we recommend to use the latest stable version of all software packages. Though other versions might also work with RQGIS, we did not test this.

Overall, RQGIS allows access to more than 1000 geoalgorithms. However, please note that the number of geoalgorithms you can use from within RQGIS depends on the platform, the system architecture, the selection of installed third-party providers and software package versions.

# Windows
<!---
There are at least two options to install QGIS on Windows in such a way that it can be accessed from RQGIS. The first option is the Standalone Installer from the [QGIS installer page](https://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html). This will install QGIS along with the third-party providers GRASS and SAGA. However, if you would like to use even more third-party providers (e.g., GDAL, GEOS, Taudem, OTB, POSTGis, etc.), we recommend to use the OSGeo4W Network installer. This installer is available on the [QGIS installer page](https://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html) as well as on the [OSGeo4W-website](http://trac.osgeo.org/osgeo4w/). 

To install OSGeo4W, the easiest way is to to use the Express installation:

</center>


We are sorry, that our installer uses a German dialog. It appears that OSGeo4w automatically uses the language in accordance with the IP-address. Nevertheless, it should be easy enough to follow our steps.

1. Select "Express Installation" 
2. Next check "QGIS, GRASS and GDAL"
3. Start the installation.

To install QGIS, we recommend to use the OSGeo4W Network installer. This installer is available on the [QGIS installer page](https://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html) as well as on the [OSGeo4W-website](http://trac.osgeo.org/osgeo4w/). Prior to the release of QGIS 2.16, one could have simply used the "Express Installation". Unfortunately, so far RQGIS does not support QGIS 2.16. Therefore, we need to install QGIS using the advanced settings. This is slightly more complicated compared to the "Express Installation" but will give you the advantage of being able to select the third-party providers you would like to use.

1. Run the OSGeo4W setup and choose the advanced installation.

2. Subsequently, accept the default settings until you reach the “Select Packages” window.

3. After expanding the command line utilities, we choose several commandline tools such as gdal and python-core (of course, you can select other components as well):

<center>
  <img src="05_command_line_utilties.PNG" width="50%" height="50%">
</center>

Additionally, we choose the Desktop-GIS GRASS 6 & 7, the Orfeo Toolbox, and of course QGIS. Please make sure to **install QGIS 2.14** since QGIS 2.16 is so far not supported by RQGIS.

4. The rest we leave as is, click "Next" and wait for the OSGeo4W-suggestions which we accept.

  <img src="08_suggestions.PNG" width="50%" height="50%">
</center>

Clicking "Next" once more will start the download and installation process which might take a while.

If you wish to to modify, uninstall or update some of the installed components, you might do so later on by running `../OSGeo4W/bin/osgeo4w-setup.exe`. Alternatively, you can download and run again the latest [OSGeo4W-executable](http://trac.osgeo.org/osgeo4w/).

If you additionally want to use the **LiDAR processing tools** (LAStools), please follow the steps found [here](https://rapidlasso.com/2013/09/29/how-to-install-lastools-toolbox-in-qgis/).

# Mac OS X

## Binary installation
For Mac, please follow this link [https://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html](https://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html) to install QGIS. Both LTR and current release will work. Please make sure to also install GDAL seperately, preferably following this link [http://www.kyngchaos.com/software/frameworks](http://www.kyngchaos.com/software/frameworks) or using your own package manager (Homebrew, Fink, MacPorts). Note that problems might occur mixing up the binary QGIS installation and framework installations from package managers. 

## Using package management systems
Since several problems occur when trying to install QGIS with package managers (e.g. [this Stackexchange question](http://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/182472/installing-qgis-using-homebrew)), it is recommended to use the binary QGIS installation. Otherwise it can not be guaranteed that all dependencies will work:

- Homebrew: If you have already QGIS running and correctly configured via Homebrew, RQGIS should work and `set_env()` should find your root path. 
- Fink: <untested>
- MacPorts: <untested>

## GRASS

## SAGA
First, download Fink from Fink Project and [install it](http://www.finkproject.org/doc/bundled/install-first.php).
Then download the following .info file for SAGA:   [http://fink.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/fink/experimental/babayoshihiko/finkinfo/saga.info](http://fink.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/fink/experimental/babayoshihiko/finkinfo/saga.info)  
Copy this file in /sw/fink/dists/local/main/finkinfo. You will need root access. Finally, run
fink install saga
This will automatically download and install necessary libraries as well.

Source: [https://sourceforge.net/p/saga-gis/wiki/Compiling%20SAGA%20on%20Mac%20OS%20X/](https://sourceforge.net/p/saga-gis/wiki/Compiling%20SAGA%20on%20Mac%20OS%20X/)

## Troubleshooting
Warnings appears when running any RQGIS command. Does not affect usage.

# Linux

## QGIS (and GRASS)
If you install QGIS with the built-in software managers, you will most likely get an outdated QGIS version. To install more recent QGIS releases, we recommend to follow the installation instructions from the [QGIS installers website](https://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/alldownloads.html). 

Here, we just describe exemplarily the QGIS installation procedure under Debian/Ubuntu following the description found [here](https://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/alldownloads.html#debian-ubuntu). RQGIS should work as well with Linux derivatives other than Ubuntu. However, we did not test this.

Open a terminal window. First of all, make sure to remove QGIS and GRASS packages you may have installed before from other repositories:

<!--http://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/167472/qgis-2-8-ubuntu-14-04-installation-issues-terminal-command-attempts-to-install-->
```sh 
sudo apt-get --purge remove qgis
sudo apt autoremove --purge remove 
sudo apt autoremove
sudo apt-get update
```

Next add the correct repository to sources.list. Make sure to use the QGIS long-term release since RQGIS so far does not support QGIS 2.16 (for Ubuntu 14.04 replace xenial by trusty):

```sh
# add QGIS repository for Ubuntu 16.04 to sources.list
sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://qgis.org/ubuntugis-ltr xenial main" >> /etc/apt/sources.list'
sudo sh -c 'echo "deb-src http://qgis.org/ubuntugis-ltr xenial main" >> /etc/apt/sources.list'
sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/ubuntugis/ubuntugis-unstable/ubuntu xenial main" >> /etc/apt/sources.list'
```

After that, we can install QGIS and GRASS as follows:

```sh
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install qgis python-qgis qgis-plugin-grass
```

If this results in keyserver errors, add the qgis.org repository public key to your apt keyring:

```sh
wget -O - http://qgis.org/downloads/qgis-2015.gpg.key | gpg --import
# to verify, run:
# gpg --fingerprint 3FF5FFCAD71472C4
gpg --export --armor 3FF5FFCAD71472C4 | sudo apt-key add -
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install qgis python-qgis qgis-plugin-grass
```

This will install the QGIS 2.14 release (LTR) as well as GRASS-GIS as third-party provider. 

## SAGA
<!---
To use SAGA functions within (R)QGIS, you naturally need to install SAGA GIS. To install the most recent SAGA version, simply execute the following lines in a terminal window: 

```sh
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:johanvdw/saga-gis  
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install saga
```
sudo add-apt-repository --remove ppa:johanvdw/saga-gis
--->

Unfortunately, QGIS does not support the latest SAGA versions. To find out which SAGA versions are supported by your QGIS installation, run:

```{r saga, eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE, message = FALSE}
library("RQGIS")
saga_support()
```

This also means we cannot simply use a package manager to install SAGA. Instead we need to compile one of the SAGA versions, QGIS supports. Using one of those versions, automatically will add SAGA to the processing toolbox of QGIS (this might not be true for SAGA >= 2.2.1 see further below). Prior to the SAGA installation, we need to install various dependencies required by SAGA. Here, we just quickly show how to install SAGA and its dependencies under Ubuntu. Please refer to [https://sourceforge.net/p/saga-gis/wiki/Compiling%20a%20Linux%20Unicode%20version/](https://sourceforge.net/p/saga-gis/wiki/Compiling%20a%20Linux%20Unicode%20version/) for a more comprehensive SAGA installation guide. Please note that we simply present in great parts a copy of this guide here.

First of all, install all necessary SAGA dependencies:

```sh
sudo apt-get install libwxgtk3.0-dev libtiff4-dev libgdal-dev libproj-dev libjasper-dev libexpat1-dev wx-common libexpat1-dev libogdi3.2-dev proj unixodbc-dev

sudo apt-get install g++ make automake libtool subversion
```

<!---
First option:

1. Donwload the SAGA-version you would like to a folder you have access to (e.g.)
mkdir /home/jannes/saga-svn
2. Unzip/unpack SAGA in this folder
3. open the terminal and change the directory to the SAGA folder
```sh
autoreconf -i
./configure
make
make install
saga_gui
export SAGA_MLB=/usr/local/lib/saga
saga_cmd
```
--->

Secondly, create a folder named `saga-svn` (e.g., in your home directory) to which you would like to download SAGA. Next, change to this folder and specifiy the SAGA release you would like to install (here: 2.2.0) by checking the corresponding branch. Changing the directory again to ~/saga-svn/release-2-2-0/saga-gis, finally sets you up for the SAGA compilation. The compilation installs SAGA to `/usr/local/lib`. 

```sh
mkdir ~/saga-svn
cd ~/saga-svn
svn checkout svn://svn.code.sf.net/p/saga-gis/code-0/branches/release-2-2-0
cd ~/saga-svn/release-2-2-0/saga-gis
sudo autoreconf -i
sudo ./configure
sudo make
sudo make install
```

To check if SAGA was successfully compiled, run:

```
saga_cmd
saga_gui
```

Sometimes `saga_gui` produces following error message:

```sh
saga_gui: error while loading shared libraries: libsaga_gdi-2.2.0.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
```
In this case, you have to enable the SAGA GUI by specifying the path where `libsaga_gdi-2.2.0.so` is located:
```sh
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
saga_gui
```

Using SAGA >= 2.2.1 you might encounter following message in the Processing log when opening QGIS: `Problem with SAGA installation: installed SAGA version (2.2.1) is not supported`. Though in this case SAGA is not available in the processing toolbox, you are still able to use it via the QGIS Python API and therefore also with RQGIS.

In case you would like to uninstall SAGA, type:

```sh
cd ~/saga-svn/release-2-2-0/saga-gis
sudo make uninstall
```

## Orfeo Toolbox (OTB)
You can download the Orfeo Toolbox from [here](https://www.orfeo-toolbox.org/download/). We save the .run-script to the Desktop. Of course, you might select any other accesible folder. Next, we create a folder named "Applications" to which we move the .run script. Finally, we install OTB. Please note that so far there is only a **64-bit** OTB version available. This version does not work on 32-bit machines!

```sh
mkdir /home/<YourUserName>/Applications/
mv /home/<YourUserName>/Desktop/<filename> /home/<YourUserName>/Applications
sh /home/<YourUserName>/Applications/<NameOfScript>
```
(R)QGIS assumes that the "OTB applications folder" is located at "/usr/lib/otb/applications" (see also [QGIS manual](https://docs.qgis.org/2.14/en/docs/user_manual/processing/3rdParty.html#orfeo-toolbox)). Therefore, we need to move the OTB installation to the corresponding folder: 

```sh
# move applications folder
sudo mv /home/<YourUserName>/Applications/<YourOTBInstallation>/lib/otb /usr/lib/
# commandline tools
cp -a /home/<YourUserName>/Applications/<YourOTBInstallation>/bin/. /usr/bin
```
OTB algorithms should be now availabe in the "Processing Toolbox" and in RQGIS (use `find_algorithms()` to check). Finally, we clean up after ourselves by deleting the previously created Applications folder:

```sh
rmdir /home/<YourUserName>/Applications/
```
